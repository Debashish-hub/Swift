// Suppose you are checking student's scores and want to assign grades based on their scores.


let score = 40

if score >= 90 {
    print("A")

// Swift also supports logical operators like AND (&&), OR (||), NOT (!), EQUAL (==), and NOT EQUAL (!=).

// Example

let isMember = false
let hasCoupon = false

if isMember || hasCoupon {
    print("You get a discount!")
} else {
    print("No discount available.")
}


// Switch Statement - Multiple Cases

// Example
let day = "Monday"

switch day {
case "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday":
    print("It's a weekday.")
case "Saturday", "Sunday":
    print("It's the weekend!")
default:
    print("Not a valid day.")
}


let mark = 90

switch mark {
case 90...100:
    print("Grade: A")
case 80..<90:
    print("Grade: B")
case 70..<80:
    print("Grade: C")
default:
    print("Grade: D")
}


// For Loop - Iterating over a range of numbers

for i in 1...5 {
    print("Iteration \(i)")
}


for j in 1..<5 {
    print("Iteration \(j)")
}


// While loop - executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true

var counter = 1

while counter <= 5 {
    print("Hello, World!")
    counter += 1
}


// Repeat-While loop - executes a block of code once, and then repeats the execution as long as a specified condition is true

var repeatCounter = 1

repeat {
    print("Hello, Swift!")
    repeatCounter += 1
} while repeatCounter <= 5


// What is the difference between while and repeat-while?

// Write code that prints only even numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
